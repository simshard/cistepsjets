## Continuous integration

automating the checks and actions to perform before merging code changes to the main branch

Using **GitHub Actions** to create YAML workflow files to build and run automated processes. 
 - Linting
 - Unit tests
 - Type checks
 - checking out code
 - Setup of software like composer or PHP , Pint etc
 - creating reusable composite actions keeping your workflow DRY
 - caching code that will be often repeated  eg data retrieval calls
